## Challenge Alignment: "AI for Better Living & Smarter Communities"

- **Better Everyday Living**: Ordinary families, homemakers, and students face volatile kitchen expenses when staple vegetable prices jump unpredictably. The app transforms raw market fluctuations into a clear, actionable decision: **Buy now / Wait / Buy a little**, protecting household budgets.
- **Inclusive Communities**: Built with an inclusive Telugu-first interface, native voice playback (**"వినండి"**), high-contrast badges, and large touch targets ($\ge 56\text{px}$) designed for elderly citizens, non-English speakers, and first-time smartphone users.
- **Smarter Communities**: Replaces guesswork with transparent local intelligence, combining seasonal statistical machine learning (Holt-Winters) with retrieved agricultural economics research (RAG) and honest backtest accuracy disclosures.

## How AI is Used

| AI Component | Role in Application | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statistical ML Forecasting** | Forecasts next week's price and 4-week prediction intervals | Pure TypeScript Holt-Winters Additive model (52-week seasonality) with in-sample grid search and 12-week rolling backtest |
| **RAG Knowledge Retrieval** | Grounds explanations in verified agricultural facts | TF-IDF vectorizer + Cosine Similarity indexing 10 curated markdown notes with contextual seasonal/direction boosting |
| **Natural Language Synthesis** | Explains reasoning in conversational Telugu or English | Deterministic template fallback + optional Google Gemini REST API integration (temperature 0.2, 8s timeout) |

## Try It in 30 Seconds

1. **Tap "🍅 ఉదాహరణ చూడండి (Try an example)"**: Instantly loads Tomato's forecast, showing how low-confidence volatility triggers a protective downgrade to **"కొద్దిగా మాత్రమే కొనండి (Buy a little)"**.
2. **Switch Language**: Tap the **"English / తెలుగు"** toggle in the header to switch languages on the fly.
3. **Tap "🔊 వినండి (Listen)"**: Hear the recommendation read aloud in natural speech.
4. **Open "ఈ అంచనా గురించి (About this prediction)"**: Review the honest 12-week backtest MAPE compared against the Naive persistence baseline.

## 1. Problem Statement

---

## 2. Solution

**"Buy Now or Wait"** (*కొనాలా? ఆగాలా?*) gives clear, actionable buying advice in simple Telugu or English:
1. **Tap any of 8 essential vegetables**: Tomato, Onion, Potato, Brinjal, Okra, Green Chilli, Cabbage, or Carrot (or tap the microphone button and speak the name).
2. **Instant Forecast**: A statistical Holt-Winters additive model predicts next week's price and 4-week bounds.
3. **Clear Verdict**:
   - 🟢 **ఇప్పుడే కొనండి (Buy Now)**: If price is projected to rise by $\ge 8\%$.
   - 🛑 **ఆగండి, ధర తగ్గవచ్చు (Wait)**: If price is projected to fall by $\ge 8\%$.
   - ⚖️ **కొద్దిగా మాత్రమే కొనండి (Buy a Little)**: If prices are stable (between $-8\%$ and $+8\%$) or if forecast confidence is Low.
4. **Contextual Explanation (RAG)**: Retrieves grounded agricultural economic notes from RBI research and market observations to explain *why* the price is shifting.
5. **Speech Synthesis**: Listen to the recommendation in natural Telugu or English voice.

## 5. Machine Learning Details & Honest Backtest Table

### Model Architecture
- **Additive Holt-Winters Model**:
  $$\hat{y}_{t+h} = L_t + h \cdot T_t + S_{t+h-m}$$
  $$L_t = \alpha(y_t - S_{t-m}) + (1 - \alpha)(L_{t-1} + T_{t-1})$$
  $$T_t = \beta(L_t - L_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta)T_{t-1}$$
  $$S_t = \gamma(y_t - L_t) + (1 - \gamma)S_{t-m}$$
  where seasonal period $m = 52$ weeks.
- **Hyperparameter Fitting**: In-sample grid search across:
  - $\alpha \in \{0.1, 0.3, 0.5\}$
  - $\beta \in \{0.01, 0.05\}$
  - $\gamma \in \{0.1, 0.3, 0.5\}$
  minimizing sum of squared errors.
- **Prediction Intervals**:
  $$\text{Interval}_h = \hat{y}_{N+h} \pm 1.28 \times \sigma_{\text{residual}} \times \sqrt{h} \quad (\text{clamped at } 0)$$
- **Confidence Rating**:
  - **High**: $\text{modelMAPE} < 6\%$ and beats naive baseline.
  - **Medium**: $\text{modelMAPE} < 12\%$. (Never exceeds Medium if it does not beat naive).
  - **Low**: $\text{modelMAPE} \ge 12\%$.

### Honest 12-Week Rolling-Origin Backtest Results
*(Evaluated via `npm run evaluate` across the latest 12 weeks of data)*

| Item | Telugu Name | Latest Price | Next Wk Forecast | 7-Day Change | Model MAPE | Naive MAPE | Beats Naive? | Confidence |

| **Onion** | ఉల్లిపాయ | ₹54.14 | ₹67.01 | +23.8% | 3.22% | 5.01% | ✅ Yes | **High** |
| **Potato** | బంగాళదుంప | ₹35.04 | ₹30.60 | -12.7% | 9.00% | 4.49% | ❌ No | **Medium** |
| **Brinjal** | వంకాయ | ₹31.80 | ₹31.51 | -0.9% | 5.51% | 6.61% | ✅ Yes | **High** |
| **Okra** | బెండకాయ | ₹37.82 | ₹38.19 | +1.0% | 7.69% | 6.94% | ❌ No | **Medium** |
| **Green Chilli** | పచ్చిమిర్చి | ₹49.63 | ₹56.45 | +13.7% | 8.06% | 7.64% | ❌ No | **Medium** |
| **Cabbage** | క్యాబేజీ | ₹23.03 | ₹25.08 | +8.9% | 7.79% | 8.51% | ✅ Yes | **Medium** |
| **Carrot** | క్యారెట్ | ₹28.85 | ₹29.69 | +2.9% | 6.76% | 6.57% | ❌ No | **Medium** |

- **Average Model MAPE**: 9.53%
- **Average Naive Baseline MAPE**: 7.68%
- **Items Beating Naive Baseline**: 3 / 8 (Onion, Brinjal, Cabbage)
- **Automatic Downgrade in Action**: For Tomato, recent price volatility produced a model MAPE of 28.20% (Confidence: Low). The engine automatically downgraded the raw "WAIT" signal to **"కొద్దిగా మాత్రమే కొనండి (BUY A LITTLE)"** with an explicit text explanation that caution is warranted due to forecast uncertainty.

## 6. RAG Details and Curated Sources

The RAG engine indexes 10 structured agricultural notes stored as markdown files in `docs/notes/` with YAML front-matter:

1. **Onion Nashik Rainfall**: RBI Working Paper 08/2024 *"Vegetables Inflation in India: A Study of Tomato, Onion and Potato"*, [RBI Publication 22723](https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=22723) (verified true).
2. **Seasonal Peaks**: ISAE India, *"Forecasting of Retail Price Rise in Tomato, Onion and Potato Commodities in India"*, [ISAE Publication](https://isaeindia.com/publication/download-pdf/345) (verified true).
3. **Lean Season Pressures**: RBI WP 08/2024 (verified true).
4. **Farmer Share of Consumer Rupee**: RBI WP 08/2024 (verified true).
5. **Retail vs Wholesale Price Monitoring**: CEDA mirror README, [CEDA Ashoka](https://dca-dev.ceda.ashoka.edu.in/README.html) (verified true).
6. **Arrivals Ease Post-Spike Prices**: General market observation (verified false).
7. **Festival Demand Surge**: General market observation (verified false).
8. **Storage Durability**: General guidance (verified false).
9. **Perishable Buying Strategy**: General guidance (verified false).
10. **How to Read the Forecast**: Guidance and probability notice (verified true).

### Retrieval Algorithm
- Documents are tokenized and scored using standard Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Cosine similarity is computed against query terms.
- Contextual boosts are applied:
  - Specific item matches receive $+0.45$, "all" notes receive $+0.15$.
  - Upward price direction boosts notes tagged `arrivals`, `season`, `festival`.
  - Downward price direction boosts notes tagged `arrivals`, `season`.
  - Current calendar month during monsoon (June–October) boosts notes tagged `rain`.
- In the UI:
  - `verified: true` notes display a clickable **"Source"** link.
  - `verified: false` notes are clearly labelled with **"సాధారణ సూచన (General guidance)"**.

---

## 7. Responsible-Use Notes

1. **Synthetic Demo Data**: The default weekly prices dataset (`data/prices.csv`) is generated with a deterministic pseudo-random generator simulating Indian agricultural seasonality and supply disruptions. The app renders a prominent orange banner:
   - **TE**: *"ఇది డెమో డేటా (నమూనా) - నిజమైన మార్కెట్ ధరలు కాదు"*
   - **EN**: *"Demo data (synthetic sample) - not real market prices"*
   If a real dataset is placed into `data/prices.csv` with `data/DATA_SOURCE.txt` set to the real provider, the banner automatically disappears.
2. **Guidance, Not a Guarantee**: Statistical models are planning guides. Every card includes:
   - **TE**: *"ఇది ఒక అంచనా మాత్రమే, హామీ కాదు."*
   - **EN**: *"This is a guide, not a guarantee."*
3. **No Financial or Arbitrage Claims**: The app never uses words like "guaranteed savings" or "profit". It always uses "likely" or "may".
4. **Security & Input Sanitization**: Only strict allowlisted vegetable IDs and language keys are accepted by the server. Free-form user text is never accepted or passed to LLM APIs.

3. **Additional Regional Languages**: Adding Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Marathi translations and voice models.
4. **Exogenous Shock Modeling**: Incorporating live weather radar / rainfall indices and diesel transport prices directly into the forecast equations.
